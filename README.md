## Spell Fast !

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matteocargnelutti/spellfast/master/screenshots/capture1.PNG)

A little prototype for a spelling / typing HTML5 game from back in early 2015.

The game is entirely made with HTML5 / CSS3 / JS, relying on DOM elments and CSS animations.
It is also built on responsive design and should work pretty much everywhere.
